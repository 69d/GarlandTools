------------------------------------
    PRIORITY

* Bell: close timers, click hunt or gold saucer.  reopened timers will be too large.

Teamcraft crafting list import:
so the url is https://ffxivteamcraft.com/list-import/<import string>
Where import string is base64(itemId, recipeId, quantity;)

------------------

* Add setting to unlock block heights in Bell.  Always use it in single-column mode?  How to override?
* filter for gatherable items
* filter for items used as part of a craft
* add copy isearch link button to items

------------------------------------
    TODO

* Item sorting:
Yeah looks like it might be sorted by the SortKeys of their ItemUICategory > Required Level > Item Level > Stack Size > #18

* Do something about same-name groups with different contents.  Maybe go to Links anyway and rename?

* Convert IDs to object entirely?

* Talan shop can now do 2 FC3s per NQ trade of Reinforced Spruce Plywood!

* Leve XP and repeat data in leve partials for Miu?

* Show names from other languages directly on their source blocks without the need for switching languages.

------------------------------------
    CLEANUP

* Remove craftCategories checks in gt.craft
* Remove type= and category= stuff in gt.craft step ctor.

* Remove it.groupTradeSource.item check from vendor-item-link-template in db/index.html

* Switch gt.craft gt.item.setBlockExpansion in bindEvents.  1/10.

* Remove gt.data.tables.js 1/30

------------------------------------
    SEARCH

filtering needing UI:
* equip level min/max
* craft job
* craft level min/max

------------------------------------
    FUTURE

* import role actions    

* Show gardening seeds & plants they grow!  in db already
* Natural sort to a->z sort function.

AMA requests:
* Showing items from the same sets (Associate by name)

Fishing:
* End time for Thunderbolt Eel is 3:30am, not 3am!  Fractional!

Group goals:
* Show gatherable items (fishing/nodes) in the crafting tab under goal, for one gc supply stop.
* Craft as a collectable (disregards yields)

Quest stuff:
quest xp formula from vekien: (base * paramgrow * (50 + 5 * level)) / 100;
player mp formula from nemekh: rounddown((base_value * MpMod/100) + rounddown((CurrentPie - 218) * 540/100 * mpmod/100))  (base_value: index 5 of ParamGrow, MpMod: index 10 of ClassJob)
* Questing tab in groups that collects all issuers and levels?

Glorious future:
* Account system for saving lists across machines.
* Instance maps with markers for coffers!
* Show venture costs in the crafting currency line (take view.price objs?)

Search project:
* Filtering quests by level.
